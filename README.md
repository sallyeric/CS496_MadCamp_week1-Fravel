## Tab Application : Fravel (Food & Travel platform)
A social sharing application for restaurants that can organically link contacts, galleries, and maps.
"Fravel" is a word that combines 'food' and 'travel', and is a service that allows you to share your local restaurants with photos and reviews like local people.
In this project, we were able to develop an application with a level of completeness that is actually usable in addition to visualizing restaurant information using the Google Maps api.


### TAB1

> LIST of Contacts

* Recycler View, Firebase DB : The contact information of the restaurants uploaded to Firebase was fetched and displayed in the Recyclerview. Tabs are implemented using fragments and viewpagers. After creating three fragments, we added tabs and viewpagers to the main activity.

### TAB2

> Gallery

* Glide Library, Photo View, Recycler View : Glide library helped to speed up the uploading images. 
On the single image show screen, with the github library, we can zoom in the image. And using the prefer button, can change the selected specific images or all images list.


### TAB3

> Map

* Google Maps, Recycler view: With the android's calendar view, we can get them on the tab3. To add the schedules on the specific day, we used recycler view to show the schedules we added by clicking the button at the bottom. 


### Others

> Splash Screen
* Google Maps, Recycler view: Not a fake splash screen that takes a few seconds, it's actually a step of getting access to the application to run.

> Log-in / Sign up Page
* Google Maps, Recycler view: 

> Upload Screen

> Firebase Database and Storage
* Google Firebase :

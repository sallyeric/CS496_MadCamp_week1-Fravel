## Tab Application : Fravel (Food & Travel platform)

A social sharing application for restaurants that can organically link contacts, galleries, and maps.
"Fravel" is a word that combines 'food' and 'travel', and is a service that allows you to share your local restaurants with photos and reviews like local people.
In this project, we were able to develop an application with a level of completeness that is actually usable in addition to visualizing restaurant information using the Google Maps api.


### TAB1

> LIST of Contacts

* Recycler View, Json, Itemtouchhelper (swiping & dragging to change the order function): Using the json file we construts the contacts list. In the tab we can add the new contact with name and phone number. With swiping the item, we can erase the contact from the screen. With drag and drop, we can change the order of the contacts. By long clicking the contact, the screen will be moved to dial screen.

### TAB2

> Gallery

* Glide Library, Photo View, Grid View : Basically we used the grid view to show the photos from the Firebase Storage we made. To take all of them we apply the cursor from the managedquery. Glide library helped to speed up the uploading images. On the single image show screen, with the github library (link: com.github.chrisbanes:PhotoView:2.1.3), we can zoom in the image. And using the prefer button, can change the selected specific images or all images list.


### TAB3

> Map

* Google Maps, Recycler view: With the android's calendar view, we can get them on the tab3. To add the schedules on the specific day, we used recycler view to show the schedules we added by clicking the button at the bottom. 


### Others

> Splash Screen
* Google Maps, Recycler view: Not a fake splash screen that takes a few seconds, it's actually a step of getting access to the application to run.
